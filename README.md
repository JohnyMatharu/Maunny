# Maunny

# Description
A very common problem that people are facing now a days when dealing with when purchasing a vehicle is that they have cannot get comprehensive information that would assit them in making a correct purchase decision. This is why they are stuck with a wrong vehicle for years, and something that even does not function properly. Maunny is a web application which acts as an online dealership, a basic car marketplace. Users can search the name of a car manufacturer, car model, and features including mileage, and year of manufacturing. This will cover the job of a salesman. They can submit their credit scores, and estimated payment calculator will be displayed. Once they submit their interest someone from finance team can contact them by placing information on Dealertrack, meaning they can be approved without even coming to an actual dealership. No dealership will give them payment estimate before they show the vehicle, with Maunny payment calculator, user can calculate payment interval (i.e weekly, biweekly and monthly), interest rates, finance duration and down payment/exchange car. 

Previously searched for cars are displayed in the search history, and can be searched for again by clicking on the car name in the search history. When user press submit button on select vehicle section; data will be stored in the local storage and a customer representative can contact the customer within 30 Minutes.

The layout was created with HTML, with additional styling via custom CSS. JQuery was used in combination with javaScript.
