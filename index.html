//Step #1: Build a Small Application: use 3rd party API to import some valuable data from other sides
With your new skills, you may be tempted to incorporate external data in your existing portfolio, like displaying today's weather. But why not take things a step further? Try building a small application that's enticing to prospective employers. For example, you could build a dynamic weather app that uses the browser API to get the user's location, then makes a request to an external API to display the weather. Be sure to push the final page to GitHub, get a live site going, and write a fully formed README file.


//pseudocode
On the left menu bar you can choose options on the site, such as draggable to get the demo how to use it

Also you can create taskinator/task or task master to create schedules for people to trace their service schedule 
Form Reset: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/reset

To import a Google Font, you can copy the font's URL from the Google Fonts library and then paste it in your HTML. For this challenge, we'll import the Lobster font.
